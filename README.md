# Homework III - WebGL
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2020
***

# Purpose

The WebGL API is supported in the recent versions of all the major browsers. It exploits the system's GPU to render 3D graphics. WebGL runs in a browser which handles user input in order to allow interactive graphics.

This assignment familiarizes us with various aspects of WebGL: the coordinate system, shading, writing shaders, writing an application program, implementing functionality like transformations in shaders, and handling user interaction. For this assignment, we will also have to look up relevant HTML and JavaScript functionality. This is unavoidable as they embed WebGL. Luckily, both are extensively documented online and students have previously been able to pick these up efficiently very quickly.

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- be comfortable reading code in a high level programming language,
- know the basic geometric types and their operations,
- have completed the Mandelbot question from HW 2,
- be familiar with color interpolation,
- know WebGL's coordinate system and drawing routines.
- know how to send data from an application program to a shader,
- know how to transform vertices in a shader, and
- be able to look up, where necessary, and implement the functions and syntax in HTML and JavaScript for desired functionality.

# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw3.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Grading

Grading will be as per the criteria specified in the accompanying review file, _hw3-review.xlsx_.

# Submission

There are 3 parts to this assignment.

## 3.1 Solving the Problem Set

Each questions in the problem set identifies the names of the files to write for it. Please follow the naming instructions exactly otherwise they will be difficult to find and grade. The correctly name files in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your submission. As your submission will be graded by your peers, please do not include identifying information in it.

Deadline: 18h on Monday, 12 October

## 3.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your teammate and on the assignment. The related form will be available on LMS with further instructions.

Deadline: 18h on Wednesday, 14 October

## 3.3 Peer Review

You will review and grade 2 submissions which will be shared with you. The related instructions will be available on LMS with further instructions.

Deadline: 18h on Wednesday, 14 October

# Discussion

Please use the following avenues:

- discuss with your teammate,
- the discussion forum on LMS,
